record added to the listed tables(s) via @{endpoint /insert/records} with the
chosen columns' values falling within the specified region will trip the
trigger. All such records will be queued at the trigger port (by default '9001'

client to collect. Active triggers can be cancelled by using the
@{endpoint /clear/trigger} endpoint or by clearing all relevant tables.
