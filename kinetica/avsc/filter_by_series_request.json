other points in the table that fall within specified ranges (spatial and
temporal) of all points of the given track. Additionally, the user can specify
another track to see if the two intersect (or go close to each other within the
specified ranges). The user also has the flexibility of using different metrics
for the spatial distance calculation: Euclidean (flat geometry) or Great Circle
(spherical geometry to approximate the Earth's surface distances). The filtered
points are stored in a newly created result set. The return value of the
function is the number of points in the resultant set (view).

This operation is synchronous, meaning that a response will not be returned
until all the objects are fully available.",
