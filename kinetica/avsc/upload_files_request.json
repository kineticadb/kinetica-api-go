    "doc": "Uploads one or more files to {KiFS}@{link /tools/kifs/}. There are
two methods for uploading files: load files in their entirety, or load files in
parts. The latter is recommeded for files of approximately 60 MB or larger.

To upload files in their entirety, populate @{input file_names} with the file
names to upload into on KiFS, and their respective byte content in
@{input file_data}.

Multiple steps are involved when uploading in multiple parts. Only one file at a
time can be uploaded in this manner. A user-provided UUID is utilized to tie all
the upload steps together for a given file.  To upload a file in multiple parts:

1. Provide the file name in @{input file_names}, the UUID in
   the {multipart_upload_uuid}@{key of input options} key in @{input options}, and
   a {multipart_operation}@{key of input options} value of
   {init}@{choice of input.key options.multipart_operation}.
2. Upload one or more parts by providing the file name, the part data
   in @{input file_data}, the UUID, a {multipart_operation}@{key of input options}
   value of {upload_part}@{choice of input.key options.multipart_operation}, and
   the part number in the {multipart_upload_part_number}@{key of input options}.
   The part numbers must start at 1 and increase incrementally.
   Parts may not be uploaded out of order.
3. Complete the upload by providing the file name, the UUID, and a
   {multipart_operation}@{key of input options} value of
   {complete}@{choice of input.key options.multipart_operation}.

Multipart uploads in progress may be canceled by providing the file name, the
UUID, and a {multipart_operation}@{key of input options} value of
{cancel}@{choice of input.key options.multipart_operation}.  If an new upload is
initialized with a different UUID for an existing upload in progress, the
pre-existing upload is automatically canceled in favor of the new upload.

The multipart upload must be completed for the file to be usable in KiFS.
Information about multipart uploads in progress is available in
@{endpoint /show/files}.

File data may be pre-encoded using base64 encoding. This should be indicated
using the {file_encoding}@{key of input options} option, and is recommended when
using JSON serialization.

Each file path must reside in a top-level KiFS directory, i.e. one of the
directories listed in @{endpoint /show/directories}. The user must have write
permission on the directory. Nested directories are permitted in file name
paths. Directories are deliniated with the directory separator of '/'.  For
example, given the file path '/a/b/c/d.txt', 'a' must be a KiFS directory.

These characters are allowed in file name paths: letters, numbers, spaces, the
path delimiter of '/', and the characters: '.' '-' ':' '[' ']' '(' ')' '#' '='.
